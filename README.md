# 🎓 Apna College “Prime (AI/ML Batch)” – Learning Repository

> This repository holds **all my lecture notes, homework, mini-projects, code files, and major assignments** for the Prime (AI/ML) batch.  
> I’ll upload everything I work on — so this becomes my live portfolio and learning log as I build out AI/ML & Data Science skills.

## ✅ My Goals for This Batch

- Build a strong foundation in **AI/ML** from basics (Python, math) → advanced (Transformers, Gen-AI).  
- Complete **at least 3 major projects** + several smaller ones, all documented & uploaded.  
- Maintain discipline: upload regularly after each lecture/homework, use branches/commits correctly on GitHub.  
- By end of batch: be confident in applying for **AI/ML internships or entry-level roles**, with real code & projects to show.  
- Turn this repository into part of my portfolio: shareable, documented, version-controlled.
